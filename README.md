# dashio-backend

"Fully fledged dashboard, in minutes."

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

Should work with `node` and `npm` too!

## Why releasing backend before the frontend?

Backend is practically a mirror of our final architecture, releasing it first makes us think better about it and receive feedback from others about what we could change.

## Contributing

If you see something we could do better, create an issue! Even though PRs are welcome, issues are easier for us to review.
